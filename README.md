## 🚀 Quick Start

To get the Comfort & Pondlike 
website up and running on your 
local machine, follow these steps:

### 1. Local Development Setup

1.  **Download/Clone the 
Project**: If you received a 
`.zip` file, extract it. If you 
are cloning from a repository, 
use:
    ```bash
   git clone 
https://github.com/yourusername/co
mfort-pondlike.git
   cd comfort-pondlike
    ```

2.  **Start the Main Website 
(Frontend)**:
    The frontend is a static 
website (HTML, CSS, JS). To view 
it correctly, you need a local 
HTTP server to avoid browser 
security restrictions (`file://` 
protocol issues). The easiest way 
is using Python's built-in 
server:
    ```bash
    # Ensure you are in the 
'comfort-pondlike' root directory
    python3 -m http.server 8000
    ```
    -   Open your web browser and 
navigate to: `http://localhost:8000`
    -   If `python3` command 
doesn't work, try `python -m 
http.server 8000`.

3.  **Start the Admin Panel 
(Backend)**:
    The admin panel is a Node.js 
application. You'll need Node.js 
and npm installed.
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the admin 
directory
    cd admin
    # Install Node.js dependencies
    npm install
    # Start the admin panel server
    npm start
    ```
    -   Open your web browser and 
navigate to: 
`http://localhost:3001/admin`
